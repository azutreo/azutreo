## About
Hello everyone! I am Nicholas Foreman, a seventeen-year-old software developer based in Louisiana. My primary language is Lua, however I have explored other languages such as C++ and Python in the past. I have a deep interest in game engines, especially advanced concepts, algorithms, and frameworks. Along with developing, I enjoy playing games such as Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, VR, etc. However, my two favorite games are actually platforms: Roblox and CoreGames, as they provide endless opportunities for new content to make and play.
