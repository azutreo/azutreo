## About
Hello everyone! I am Nicholas Foreman, a software developer based in Louisiana. My primary language is Lua, however I have explored other languages such as C++, Python, Java, and C# in the past. I have a deep interest in game engines, especially advanced concepts, algorithms, and frameworks. Very familiar with communities, public speaking along with communication among developers, client/server replication, quality assurance testing, moderation, and IT solutions.


Along with developing, I enjoy playing games such as Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, VR, etc. However, my two favorite games are actually platforms: Roblox and CoreGames, as they provide endless opportunities for new content to make and play.
